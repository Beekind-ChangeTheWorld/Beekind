        <h3>Why we need bees:</h3>
        <p>
            Since their existence 76 million years ago, bees have played a crucial role in the natural environment by helping maintain the steady flow of food from flowering plants to animals. In recent years, however, bee populations have been on an exponential decline due to the increase in pollution, loss of habitat, and infectious parasites. As already seen by some studies (UN), this decline has had a profound impact on agricultural production, which has in turn decreased food availability. This is why it is crucial that we collectively make an effort to strive for a more eco-friendly and sustainable lifestyle in order to not only decrease our waste and CO2 footprint but also to save the bees. Overall, although many of us donâ€™t even realise it, bees and other pollinators are an essential part of our existence, which is why it is crucial that they maintain a healthy population. By supporting biological, local farmers and planting flowers in our gardens or balconies, you can support the local bee population and ensure their survival for everyone's benefit.
        </p>

        <h3>What do we do?</h3>
        <p>
            As a group, we strive to improve our local environment by supporting our own beehive, located near the La Chataigneraie Campus. To ensure we are successful, we have put together four main goals which are; Raising awareness and educating about the importance of pollinators, introducing honey bees and beekeeping to the Ecolint community, increasing biodiversity on the campus and producing local organic honey. With these goals, we will strive to support our bees and share our passion for beekeeping to the local community with the goal of getting more people involved in the cause. 
        </p>

        <h3>What can you do?</h3>
        <p>
            As an individual, there are many amazing and creative things you can do to maintain your local bee population. Firstly, it is crucial to support local, organic farmers to guarantee the survival of their farm and to ensure their continuous fight against pesticides. To do this, you can buy their products as well as buying biological products from the supermarket. Moreover, you can plant flowering plants in your garden or balcony to attract pollinators and ensure that there is enough food for them in the environment. As a consequence, this will also bring you beautiful flowers, fruits or vegetables. Finally, you can place your own beehive in your garden, school or local field which will boost the bee population, teach you everything about bees and produce your own local and delicious honey!
